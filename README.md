# bomberman
High school grade 12 computer science final project - the game bomberman recreated in java by myself and a partner 

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes the players freeze, jump, or speed up in the middle of a movement due to animation lag
- Sometimes there is a lag in the bombs
- Occasionally the players and enemies would go into blocks

Fixed Bugs:
- Blocks would not respawn in different locations when replaying the game without closing the program - was fixed by resetting drawcheck variable when the game ends

To run, start program from the main menu file
