Goal: Defeat the other player!
You can defeat the other player by either destroying all of their lives 
or getting more points.

How is the winner determined?
If one player loses all three of their lives before the time limit, 
they are automatically declared the loser and the round ends with 
the other player as the winner. 

If both players still have at least one life when the time limit is over, 
the winner is determined by the final number of points.

How to get points:
1. Destroying the breakable walls
2. Destroying enemies 

Destroy enemies, breakable walls and your opponent by placing bombs. 
Make sure to run away before the bomb explodes or you'll be caught in the blast!
